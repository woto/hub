Hi folks. 

First of all, I would like to say that English is my second language (Russian is first) so don't be mad at me for grammatical errors. But I prefer them cause it is still the most popular international language. And I want to stay in touch with citizens of a world.

Secondly. I would like to answer the questions like "Why did you write this?", "What made you do this?"
Ok, although I'm living not in the worst country in the world (Moscow, Russia). There is barely danger on the streets, I have a well-paid job, food, roof over my head. But it seems our country still not so opened for the international arena and as a result, there are many difficulties to work with the rest of the world.

And here is one of them. I'm interested in making payments to people in other countries from debit cards emitted in Russian Federation. I'm not a lawyer, I'm just a programmer (not the worst). I don’t want to break the law but I’m almost sure that some laws are governing these actions. But! I have no idea how to find people who know the answers to these questions and know how to do it right. Almost sure that not every tax officer has the answers to these questions.

*So. Do what you want and just go with it. Anyway if you have anything to say, please contact me.*

Here the list of applications I found in Google Play Market which seems to provide abilities to make payment transfers to friends all over the world from Russia.

Take note that I didn't use them yet so if you have an experience of using them we can talk. And as a result, the second part of the article could be published. In my opinion it's not a criminal to make a remittence to "friends" who will be willing to help to test the MVP. So we're statring:

### Western Union

It looks like most promising solution claiming a fixed fee. Will try it first.

### Sberbank
