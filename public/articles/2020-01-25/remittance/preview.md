Hi folks. 

First of all, I would like to say that English is my second language (Russian is first) so don't be mad at me for grammatical errors. But I prefer them cause it is still the most popular international language. And I want to stay in touch with citizens of a world.

Secondly. I would like to answer the questions like "Why did you write this?", "What made you do this?"
Ok, although I'm living not in the worst country in the world (Moscow, Russia). There is barely danger on the streets, I have a well-paid job, food, roof over my head. But it seems our country still not so opened for the international arena and as a result, there are many difficulties to work with the rest of the world.
