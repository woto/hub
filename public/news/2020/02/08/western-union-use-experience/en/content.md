Ok, I'm glad to inform that I've made first payment into Ukraine with payment system Western Union. It were quiet easy.
Maybe my concerns were overblown. Anyway here is results:

And as you can see rate in application were:  
1 USA Dollar = 65.305 Russian Rubles (not so good)  

Plus 198 Rubles commission for remittance.
